1. Family. My family has been incredibly supportive of me making this change and since my father has experience with code it's been amazing having him as a resource
2. Work. My work has been very understanding of the new constraints that I have to my schedule and even though they know I'm leaving soon they understand and help me work around my school work.
3. Google. Praise be to the almighty lord Google and its never ending knowledge
